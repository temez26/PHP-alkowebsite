# Alko Product Catalog üç∑

This repository contains a PHP-based web application that showcases Alko‚Äôs product catalog. Users can browse and filter products by type, country of manufacture, and more.

## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The app fetches data from Alko‚Äôs servers as an XLSX file, converts it into a daily updated CSV file, and uses this CSV file to display the product table on the webpage.

### Project Structure üìÇ

- `scripts/js/Cookies.js`: Custom JavaScript handling cookies.
- `model.php`: Fetches data from Alko‚Äôs servers, extracts information from the CSV file.
- `controller.php`: Manages user input and interacts with the model and view.
- `view.php`: Renders the HTML output, displaying the product table and filters.
- `config.php`: Contains configuration settings for the CSV file.
- `index.php`: Main file including the model, controller, and view.
- `scripts/php/Pagination.php`: Manages pagination for the product table.
- `scripts/php/Form.php`: Contains inputs for the filters.
- `scripts/php/List.php`: Contains filter names for country, bottle size, and type.

### How `model.php` Fetches Latest XLSX File üìù

`model.php` contains functions:
- `console_log($output)`: Logs a message to the browser console.
- `fetchXlxs($remote_filename_xlsx, $local_filename_xlsx)`: Fetches the XLSX file from the remote URL and saves it locally.
- `xlsxToCsv($local_filename_xlsx, $local_filename_csv)`: Converts the XLSX file to a CSV file.
- `getDateFromCsv($local_filename_csv)`: Extracts the date from the CSV file.

The script executes these steps:
1. Fetch the XLSX file.
2. Convert it to a CSV file.
3. Extract the date from the CSV file.
